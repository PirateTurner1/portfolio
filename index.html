          <h4>Java Script</h4>
            <p> This is because I am interested in furthering my knowledge and skills to coding. Do not underestimate the value and worth of coding, because it can help many people reach out and advertize what ever they want. Java script is currently the most used language in the HTML world, so I thought why not hop on board and give it a try? I have learned that what does not hurt will not kill you to give something new a chance to see, feel and think about. I started to learn what code was in Middle school by clicking around and learning what the internet can really do.  I even remember freaking out as I stumbled upon other things and having to get stuck on a site or a page that never really ment anything to me.  some sites or inspection pages got so confusing. </br> Now that I am older I realized my mistakes and learned more about what things are and what sites are best to use for researching.  The internet is a great tool to learn from and pull things off of so that anyone can make sure things are done right.  I am amazed by the amount of things coding can do and how best to use them.  I find that it will take time to get to know in memorization all the tips and tricks that coding has to offer.  I want to learn so that I can help others and to protect and defend the right information from hackers who abuse the internet and try to turn things into the dark web.  </P>
